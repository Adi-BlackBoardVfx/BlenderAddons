# BlackBoardVFX Blender Addons
BlackBoard VFX is a boutique animation & post production studio that produces digital content for a variety of companies and advertising agencies. 

We use Blender3D as a main DCC (Digital Content Creation) tool, and every once in a while we come up with a new addon to make our pipeline more efficient. We think these solutions might come in handy for others in the blender community, so this is our opportunity to give back!

We hope you find this repository usefull, and welcome any suggestions or collaborations.

+ **Cache Swap** : helps us work efficiently with animation cache files, especially when the pipeline requires constant animation updates.
